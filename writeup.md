## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is a distributed Version Control System, it is the software that powers GitHub and it allows teams of all sizes to collaborate on code, while GitHub is a web interface that allows users to use Git online.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing allows one to save their changes, not necessarily updating the code for everyone else. Pushing applies all of the edits you've made via commits to the target branch of the repository.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is where you can store and host code. It stores all of the files and folders that your project might have. Most repositories have a README.md in the root directory, which can be created manually or by clicking the option while creating the repository. A repository can have branches that allow you to split up your code into different versions, which can be useful when working on a team and assigned to one specific task, so that whatever tweaks you progressively make don't disrupt changes that other people are making at the same time. By default, code is kept in the main branch, and code in other branches can be transferred over to the main branch by opening a pull request. There are also forks, which other users can make to make their own edits to your code in a separate copy of the repository. Repositories also have issues, which let other users (or yourself) report any issues they have with the code or suggestions they might have.

## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

I am most excited to (hopefully) learn about how to be able to create and train neural networks and be able to apply them in different contexts. Even if we aren't making our own, learning how they work is still interesting to me, and I'm excited to learn about all of the other aspects of AI that we'll cover this year!
